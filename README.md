# Kaggle-Fun
Practice machine learning techniques on Kaggle datasets 

## Black Friday Sales

I use both regression and classification techniques to identify likely high spenders in a Black Friday sale. The project also allowed me to practice implementing various cross-validation and subset selection techniques to reduce feature size. 

## Instacart grocery orders 

I use Postgres and sqlalchemy in Python to practice making simple to complex queries on a dataset of 3 million instacart orders. I then analyze the resulting datasets I created from the queries to draw some business insights.
